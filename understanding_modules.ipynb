    "In the same directory as this Jupyter Notebook is a Python file called \"pystats_central.py\" that has a few functions that measure central tendancy such as ```mean() ```, ```median()``` and ```mode()```. It's easy for me to use one or more of these functions in this Jupyter Notebook simply by importing the Python file (pystats_central.py). pystats_central.py, the imported python file, is then called a ***module***.\n",

For example, I got the mean of ages by calling ```mean()```, however, I must specify where this function is as it is neither a built in function nor did I define it in my current working script, therefore, Python would not recognize it otherwise. To do this, I must call it with it's module name:\n",

When we write functions in our modules, we may want to test them using executable code. To prevent these tests from being executed in our working python file, we include them under the ```if __name__ == \"__main__\"``` block as shown below:\n",
