# Pystats
---

I was learning about modules in Python and what better way to learn than to do.
Pystats is a package of Python modules equipped with functions that are used in Statistics.
I am aware that such a package already exists by the name Statistics and I'm doing this entirely for learning purposes.

While the functions are extensively documented, you can check out my Jupyter Notebooks in the Numerical Summary repo to fully understand how I came up with these functions.
