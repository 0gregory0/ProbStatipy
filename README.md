# Pystats
---

I was learning about modules in Python and what better way to learn than to do.
Pystats is a package of Python modules equipped with functions that are used in Statistics.
I am aware that such a package already exists by the name [Statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) and I'm doing this entirely for learning purposes.

While the functions are extensively documented, you can check out my Jupyter Notebooks in the [Numerical Summary repo](https://github.com/0gregory0/Numerical-Summary) to fully understand my thought process while coming up with these functions.

To understand how modules work, check out the [understanding_modules](https://github.com/0gregory0/pystats/blob/main/understanding_modules.ipynb) Notebook (which is still a work in progress, just like this repo).
